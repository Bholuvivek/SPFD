# Advanced Selectors in CSS

CSS selectors are powerful tools that allow you to target specific elements in an HTML document and apply styles to them. In addition to basic selectors like element names and class/ID selectors, CSS also provides advanced selectors that offer more granular control over styling. This README.md will cover three types of advanced selectors: attribute selectors, pseudo-classes, and pseudo-elements.

## Attribute Selectors

Attribute selectors allow you to target elements based on their attributes and attribute values.

### Example:

```css
/* Select all elements with a "target" attribute */
[target] {
  color: blue;
}

/* Select all elements with a "href" attribute that starts with "https://" */
[href^="https://"] {
  text-decoration: underline;
}
```
# 
# Pseudo-elements
- Pseudo-elements allow you to style parts of an element, such as the first letter or line of text, without adding extra markup.

# Example:
```css

/* Style the first letter of a paragraph */
p::first-letter {
  font-size: 2em;
  font-weight: bold;
}

/* Style the first line of a paragraph */
p::first-line {
  color: blue;
}
```
# Conclusion
- By using advanced selectors like attribute selectors, pseudo-classes, and pseudo-elements, you can create more dynamic and targeted styles for your web pages. Experiment with these selectors to see how they can enhance the design and functionality of your CSS.
