# CSS Preprocessors: Sass and LESS

CSS preprocessors are tools that extend the capabilities of CSS by adding features like variables, mixins, functions, and more. This README provides an introduction to two popular CSS preprocessors: Sass and LESS.

## Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets)

Sass is a mature and stable CSS preprocessor that offers a wide range of features to enhance your stylesheets. Here's a brief overview of some key features:

### Features:

1. **Variables**: Define reusable values throughout your stylesheet.
2. **Nesting**: Nest CSS rules within one another, making your code more readable and maintainable.
3. **Mixins**: Reusable blocks of styles that can be included in multiple rules.
4. **Functions**: Define custom functions for use in your stylesheets.
5. **Partials and Imports**: Break your stylesheet into smaller files and import them into your main stylesheet.
6. **Control Directives**: `@if`, `@for`, `@each`, and `@while` statements for more advanced control over your styles.
7. **Extend/Inheritance**: Share styles between selectors.

### Example:

```scss
// Variables
$primary-color: #007bff;
$secondary-color: #6c757d;

// Mixin
@mixin flex-center {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}

// Styles
.container {
  width: 100%;
  max-width: 1200px;
  margin: 0 auto;
}

.header {
  background-color: $primary-color;
  color: white;
  @include flex-center;
}
```
# LESS (Leaner CSS)
LESS is another popular CSS preprocessor that offers similar features to Sass. It's known for its simplicity and ease of use. Here's an overview of some key features:

## Features:
**Variables:** Define reusable values throughout your stylesheet.
**Mixins:** Reusable blocks of styles that can be included in multiple rules.
**Nested Rules:** Nest CSS rules within one another.
**Functions:** Define custom functions for use in your stylesheets.
**Imports:** Import external LESS files into your main stylesheet.
**Operations:** Perform arithmetic operations directly within your stylesheet.
**Extend:** Share styles between selectors.


# Example:
```less

// Variables
@primary-color: #007bff;
@secondary-color: #6c757d;

// Mixin
.flex-center {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}

// Styles
.container {
  width: 100%;
  max-width: 1200px;
  margin: 0 auto;
}

.header {
  background-color: @primary-color;
  color: white;
  .flex-center;
}
```
