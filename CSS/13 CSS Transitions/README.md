# CSS Transitions

CSS transitions allow you to smoothly change property values over a specified duration. They provide a way to add animation to elements in a web page without using JavaScript.

## Basic Syntax

```css
.element {
    transition-property: property1 property2 ...;
    transition-duration: time;
    transition-timing-function: timing-function;
    transition-delay: time;
}
```
- `transition-property: Specifies the CSS properties to which the transition should be applied.
- transition-duration: Specifies the duration of the transition in seconds or milliseconds.
- transition-timing-function: Specifies the speed curve of the transition (e.g., linear, ease, ease-in, ease-out, ease-in-out).
- transition-delay: Specifies a delay before the transition starts.
# Example
```html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>CSS Transition Example</title>
    <style>
        .box {
            width: 100px;
            height: 100px;
            background-color: red;
            transition-property: background-color;
            transition-duration: 1s;
            transition-timing-function: ease-in-out;
        }
        .box:hover {
            background-color: blue;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="box"></div>
</body>
</html>
```
 -In this example, when hovering over the .box element, its background color will smoothly transition from red to blue over a duration of 1 second.

# Conclusion
- CSS transitions only work for properties that have continuous values (e.g., color, background-color, width, height, opacity).
- Transitions are triggered by changes in CSS properties. For example, hovering over an element, adding/removing a class, or changing styles with JavaScript.
- It's important to keep in mind browser compatibility when using CSS transitions, as older browsers may not support all features or may require vendor prefixes.
