# CSS Floats

CSS Floats is a property that allows an element to be taken out of the normal flow and placed along the left or right side of its container. This is commonly used for creating layouts where elements can float next to each other.

## Basic Usage

To float an element, you can use the `float` property in your CSS:

```css
.float-left {
    float: left;
}

.float-right {
    float: right;
}
```
## Example
- Let's say you have two elements, a div and a p tag, and you want them to appear side by side:

```html

<div class="container">
    <div class="float-left">Left floated div</div>
    <p class="float-right">Right floated paragraph</p>
</div>
```css

.float-left {
    float: left;
    width: 50%; /* Adjust width as needed */
}

.float-right {
    float: right;
    width: 50%; /* Adjust width as needed */
}
```
- In this example, the div and the p tag will appear side by side, with the div floated to the left and the p tag floated to the right.

# Clearing Floats
- When using floats, it's important to clear them to prevent layout issues. There are several methods to clear floats:

# Clearfix
- The clearfix technique is commonly used to clear floats:

```css

.clearfix::after {
    content: "";
    display: table;
    clear: both;
}
```
- Apply the clearfix class to the parent container:

```html

<div class="container clearfix">
    <!-- floated elements here -->
</div>
# Clear Property
- You can also use the clear property to clear floats:

```css

.clearfix {
    clear: both;
}
```
# Apply the clearfix class to the element after the floated elements:

```html

<div class="container">
    <div class="float-left">Left floated div</div>
    <p class="float-right">Right floated paragraph</p>
    <div class="clearfix"></div>
</div>
```
