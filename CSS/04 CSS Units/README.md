# CSS Units

CSS units are used to specify the size, position, and other properties of elements in a CSS stylesheet. There are several types of units available in CSS, each with its own characteristics and use cases.

## 1. Pixel (px)

Pixels are a fixed unit of measurement commonly used in web design. One pixel corresponds to one dot on a computer screen. Pixel values do not change with different screen sizes or zoom levels.

Example:
```css
div {
    width: 200px;
    height: 100px;
    font-size: 16px;
}
```

## 2. Relative Units
- Relative units are relative to something else, such as the font size or the size of the parent element. They are useful for creating designs that are more adaptable to different screen sizes and resolutions.

# a. em
- The 'em' unit is equal to the computed value of the 'font-size' of the element.

# Example:

```css
div {
    font-size: 16px;
}

p {
    font-size: 1.5em; /* This makes the font size of 'p' 1.5 times the font size of 'div' */
}
```
# b. rem
- The 'rem' unit is similar to 'em', but it's relative to the root element's font size, which is usually the <html> element.

# Example:

```css
html {
    font-size: 16px;
}

p {
    font-size: 1.5rem; /* This makes the font size of 'p' 1.5 times the font size of the <html> element */
}
```
# c. %
- The percentage unit is a relative unit that is relative to the size of the parent element.

# Example:

```css

.parent {
    width: 300px;
}

.child {
    width: 50%; /* This makes the width of 'child' 50% of the width of 'parent' */
}
```
# Conclusion
- Understanding and using CSS units effectively is essential for creating responsive and visually appealing web layouts. By choosing the right unit for each property, you can create designs that look great on a variety of devices and screen sizes.
