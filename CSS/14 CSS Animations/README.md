## Introduction

CSS Animations enable you to animate CSS properties over a set duration. These animations can be applied to various elements on your webpage, including text, images, backgrounds, and more. CSS Animations offer a way to add interactivity and visual appeal to your web projects without the need for JavaScript.

## Basic CSS Animations

To create a basic CSS animation, you can use the `@keyframes` rule along with the `animation` property. Here's a simple example that animates the opacity of an element:

```css
@keyframes fadeIn {
  0% { opacity: 0; }
  100% { opacity: 1; }
}

.fade-in {
  animation: fadeIn 1s ease-in-out;
}
```
```<div class="fade-in">
  This text will fade in.
</div>
```
# Keyframes
- Keyframes define the stages and styles of an animation. You can specify the intermediate steps of an animation using percentages from 0% to 100%. Here's an example that animates the width of an element:

```css

@keyframes stretch {
  0% { width: 100px; }
  50% { width: 200px; }
  100% { width: 300px; }
}

.stretch-animation {
  animation: stretch 2s infinite alternate;
}
html

<div class="stretch-animation">
  This element will stretch back and forth.
</div>
```
# Transition vs Animation
- CSS Transitions and CSS Animations both allow you to change CSS properties over time, but they differ in how they are applied. Transitions are triggered by a state change, such as a hover event, while animations are more versatile and can run continuously or be triggered by other events. Here's a quick comparison:

- Use CSS Transitions for simple state-based animations.
- Use CSS Animations for more complex and continuous animations.

# Advanced Techniques
- Easing Functions: Control the acceleration and deceleration of your animations using easing functions like ease, ease-in, ease-out, ease-in-out, etc.
- Animation Delays: Delay the start of an animation using the animation-delay property.
- Animation Direction: Change the direction of an animation using the animation-direction property.
- Animation Iteration: Specify the number of times an animation should repeat using the animation-iteration-count property.
