# CSS Flexbox Layout

Flexbox is a powerful layout module in CSS that provides a more efficient way to layout, align, and distribute space among items in a container, even when their size is unknown or dynamic. This README.md file provides an overview of Flexbox along with examples to demonstrate its usage.

## Getting Started

To start using Flexbox, you just need a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.

### HTML Structure

You need a container element to apply Flexbox properties. This container will hold the items you want to layout.

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="item">Item 1</div>
  <div class="item">Item 2</div>
  <div class="item">Item 3</div>
</div>
```
# CSS Styling
- Apply Flexbox properties to the container element to control the layout of its items.

```css

.container {
  display: flex; /* Establishes a flex container */
}

.item {
  /* Styles for items within the flex container */
}
```
## Flexbox Properties
# 1. display: flex;
- This property is applied to the container element to establish a flex container.

# 2. flex-direction
Specifies the direction of the main axis. Default is row.

```css

.container {
  flex-direction: row | row-reverse | column | column-reverse;
}
```
# 3. justify-content
- Defines how items are aligned along the main axis.

```css

.container {
  justify-content: flex-start | flex-end | center | space-between | space-around | space-evenly;
}
```
# 4. align-items
- Defines how items are aligned along the cross axis.

```css

.container {
  align-items: stretch | flex-start | flex-end | center | baseline;
}
```
# 5. align-self
- Allows individual items to override the align-items value for their own alignment.

```css

.item {
  align-self: auto | flex-start | flex-end | center | baseline | stretch;
}
```
# 6. flex-grow
- Specifies how much a flex item will grow relative to the rest of the flex items.

```css

.item {
  flex-grow: <number>; /* Default is 0 */
}
```
# 7. flex-shrink
- Specifies how much a flex item will shrink relative to the rest of the flex items.

```css

.item {
  flex-shrink: <number>; /* Default is 1 */
}
```
# 8. flex-basis
- Specifies the initial size of a flex item along the main axis before free space is distributed.

```css

.item {
  flex-basis: <length> | auto; /* Default is auto */
}
```
## Examples
# Example 1: Horizontal Layout
```html

<div class="container">
  <div class="item">Item 1</div>
  <div class="item">Item 2</div>
  <div class="item">Item 3</div>
</div>
```
```css

.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
}

.item {
  width: 100px;
}
```
# Example 2: Vertical Layout
```html

<div class="container">
  <div class="item">Item 1</div>
  <div class="item">Item 2</div>
  <div class="item">Item 3</div>
</div>
```
```css

.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
}

.item {
  height: 50px;
}
```
# Conclusion
- Flexbox provides a powerful and flexible way to layout items in a container, allowing for easier alignment and distribution of space. Experiment with the different Flexbox properties to create responsive and dynamic layouts for your web projects.
