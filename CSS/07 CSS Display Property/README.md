# CSS Display Property

The `display` property in CSS determines how an element is displayed on a webpage. It specifies the rendering behavior of an element in terms of its box type, whether it's block-level or inline-level, and how it interacts with other elements.

## Block-level and Inline-level Elements

- **Block-level elements:** These elements typically start on a new line and occupy the full width available to them. They stack on top of each other vertically.
- **Inline-level elements:** These elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary. They flow alongside adjacent inline-level elements.

## Common Values of the `display` Property

1. `block`: Renders an element as a block-level element.
2. `inline`: Renders an element as an inline-level element.
3. `inline-block`: Combines the characteristics of both block-level and inline-level elements. It allows the element to have block-like properties while flowing inline with other elements.
4. `none`: Removes the element from the document flow. It essentially hides the element from the layout and doesn't reserve any space for it.

## Examples

### 1. Block-level Element

```html
<div style="display: block; background-color: skyblue; width: 200px; height: 100px;">
  This is a block-level div.
</div>
```
# 2. Inline-level Element
```html

<span style="display: inline; background-color: lightgreen;">
  This is an inline-level span.
</span>
<span style="display: inline; background-color: lightgreen;">
  Another inline-level span.
</span>
```
# 3. Inline-block Element
```html

<div style="display: inline-block; background-color: coral; width: 100px; height: 100px;">
  This is an inline-block div.
</div>
```
# 4. Hiding an Element
```bash

<p style="display: none;">
  This paragraph will not be visible on the webpage.
</p>
```
# Conclusion
- Understanding and utilizing the display property is essential for controlling the layout and structure of web elements in CSS. By choosing the appropriate value for the display property, you can achieve the desired rendering behavior for your elements.
