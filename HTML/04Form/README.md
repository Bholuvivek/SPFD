# Forms and Input Elements

Forms are essential components of web pages that allow users to input data and interact with websites. HTML provides various input elements to create forms, such as text fields, password fields, email fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, and more. Let's explore the structure of forms and different input types.

## Form Structure

The basic structure of an HTML form consists of the `<form>` element, which contains one or more input elements and a submit button. Here's an example:

```html
<form action="/submit-form" method="POST">
    <!-- Input elements go here -->
    <input type="text" name="username" placeholder="Username">
    <input type="password" name="password" placeholder="Password">
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```
# Input Types
- HTML provides various input types to capture different types of data. Some common input types include:

- Text: <input type="text"> - Used for single-line text input.
- Password: <input type="password"> - Masks the input characters for password entry.
- Email: <input type="email"> - Validates the input as an email address.
- Checkbox: <input type="checkbox"> - Allows selecting multiple options from a list.
- Radio: <input type="radio"> - Allows selecting a single option from a list.
- Submit: <input type="submit"> - Submits the form data to the server.
- Reset: <input type="reset"> - Resets the form fields to their default values.
# Form Submission and Handling
- When a user submits a form, the data is sent to the server for processing. The form's action attribute specifies the URL where the form data should be submitted, and the method attribute defines the HTTP method to be used (usually POST or GET).
