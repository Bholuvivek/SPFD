# HTML Attributes

HTML attributes provide additional information about HTML elements and define their behavior or properties. Understanding attributes is essential for building dynamic and interactive web pages.

## Understanding attributes

Attributes are added to HTML elements to provide extra information or modify the behavior of the elements. They are specified within the opening tag of an element and consist of a name and a value, separated by an equal sign (`=`).

## Common attributes

Some common HTML attributes include:

- `id`: Specifies a unique identifier for an element.
- `class`: Specifies one or more class names for an element (used for styling with CSS).
- `href`: Specifies the URL of the link destination.
- `src`: Specifies the URL of the image or media source.
- `alt`: Specifies an alternative text for an image.
- `title`: Specifies extra information about an element (typically displayed as a tooltip).

## Using attributes to add metadata and define element properties

Attributes can be used to add metadata or define properties for HTML elements. For example:

- The `alt` attribute in `<img>` elements provides alternative text for images, which is displayed if the image fails to load or for accessibility purposes.
- The `href` attribute in `<a>` elements specifies the URL of the linked page.
- The `class` attribute in various elements is used to apply CSS styles or JavaScript behaviors to those elements.
- The `id` attribute provides a unique identifier for an element, which can be used for styling or scripting purposes.

### Example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>HTML Attributes Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1 id="main-heading" class="title">Welcome to my website</h1>
    <p>This is a <a href="https://www.example.com" title="Visit Example">link</a> to Example.com.</p>
    <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of the image">
</body>
</html>

```
# In this example:

- The id attribute is used to provide a unique identifier for the <h1> element.
- The class attribute assigns the class title to the <h1> element for styling purposes.
- The href attribute specifies the link destination for the <a> element.
- The title attribute provides additional information (tooltip) for the <a> element.
- The src attribute specifies the image source for the <img> element, and the alt attribute provides alternative text for the image.
