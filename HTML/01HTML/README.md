# Introduction to HTML

## What is HTML?

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create and design web pages. It provides a structure for web content by using a system of tags and attributes to define the various elements on a webpage.

## Basic Structure of an HTML Document

An HTML document consists of several key components:

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: This declaration defines the document type and version of HTML being used.
- `<html>`: The root element that wraps all content on the page.
- `<head>`: Contains metadata about the document, such as the title and links to external resources.
- `<title>`: Defines the title of the document, which appears in the browser's title bar or tab.
- `<body>`: Contains the main content of the document,  including text, images, links, and other elements.

 # Here's a basic example of an HTML document structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First HTML Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
</body>
</html>
```
# HTML Syntax and Tags
HTML uses a set of tags to define the structure and content of a webpage. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets < > and typically come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag. The content of the element is placed between these tags.

# Common HTML Tags:
<h1>, <h2>, <h3>, ... <h6>: Headings of different levels.
<p>: Paragraph.
<a>: Anchor for creating hyperlinks.
<img>: Image.
<ul>, <ol>, <li>: Unordered and ordered lists, and list items.
<div>, <span>: Generic container elements.
<strong>, <em>: Text emphasis.
<br>, <hr>: Line break and horizontal rule.

# Example:

```
html

<h1>This is a Heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
<a href="https://example.com">Visit Example</a>
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Image Description">
<ul>
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
</ul>
