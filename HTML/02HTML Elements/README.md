# HTML Elements

In HTML, elements are building blocks of a web page. They define the structure and content of the page. Here are some common HTML elements:

## Headings

Headings are used to define the hierarchy of the content. There are six levels of headings in HTML, from `<h1>` to `<h6>`. `<h1>` represents the highest level of heading, while `<h6>` represents the lowest.

```html
<h1>This is Heading 1</h1>
<h2>This is Heading 2</h2>
<h3>This is Heading 3</h3>
...
<h6>This is Heading 6</h6>
```
# Paragraphs
- Paragraphs are used to define blocks of text. They are represented by the <p> tag.

```html
<p>This is a paragraph. It contains some text.</p>

```
# Links
- Links are used to navigate between different pages or resources. They are represented by the <a> tag.

```bash
<a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example Website</a>
```
 # Images
- Images are used to display visual content on a web page. They are represented by the <img> tag.

```bash
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of the image">
Lists (Ordered and Unordered)
Lists are used to represent a group of related items. There are two types of lists: ordered lists (<ol>) and unordered lists (<ul>).
```
Ordered List
```bash

<ol>
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
    <li>Item 3</li>
</ol>
```
# Unordered List
```bash
<ul>
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
    <li>Item 3</li>
</ul>
```
 # Tables
- Tables are used to display data in rows and columns. They are represented by the <table>, <tr>, <th>, and <td> tags.

```
html

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Heading 1</th>
        <th>Heading 2</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Data 1</td>
        <td>Data 2</td>
