# Accessibility in Web Development

Accessibility in web development ensures that people with disabilities can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with web content effectively. This document covers two important aspects of web accessibility: ARIA roles and attributes and semantic markup.

## ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) Roles and Attributes

ARIA is a set of attributes that define ways to make web content and applications more accessible to people with disabilities. It provides additional information to assistive technologies, such as screen readers, to interpret web content correctly.

### Example:
```html
<button role="button" aria-label="Close">
    <span aria-hidden="true">×</span>
</button>
```
- In this example, the button has a role of "button" to indicate its purpose. The aria-label attribute provides a descriptive label for the button, and the aria-hidden attribute hides the "×" symbol from assistive technologies while still allowing visual users to see it.

# Semantic Markup for Accessibility
- Semantic markup refers to using HTML elements that convey meaning and structure to both users and machines. Proper use of semantic elements improves accessibility by providing context and structure to web content.

# Example:
```html 
<nav>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
        <li><a href="/about">About</a></li>
        <li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li>
    </ul>
</nav>
```
