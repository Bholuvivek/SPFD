# Styling HTML Elements with CSS

In web development, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style HTML elements, making web pages visually appealing and enhancing user experience. This document covers the basics of styling HTML elements using CSS.

## Applying Styles to Text

CSS provides various properties to style text content, including:

### Font Properties

```css
/* Example of font properties */
p {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    font-size: 16px;
    font-weight: bold;
    color: #333333;
}
```
```css
/* Example of text color */
h1 {
    color: blue;
}

/* Example of background color */
body {
    background-color: #f0f0f0;
}

```

# Box Model
- The box model describes the design and layout of elements in CSS. It consists of the following properties:

**Margin:** Space outside the border of an element.
**Padding:** Space between the content and the border of an element.
**Border:** Border around the content and padding of an element.

# Positioning Elements
- CSS offers different positioning options for elements:

**Static:** Default positioning behavior. Elements are positioned according to the normal flow of the document.
**Relative:** Positioned relative to its normal position.
**Absolute:** Positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor.
**Fixed:** Positioned relative to the viewport.

```css
/* Example of element positioning */
div {
    position: relative;
}

/* Example of absolute positioning */
h1 {
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
}

/* Example of fixed positioning */
footer {
    position: fixed;
    bottom: 0;
    width: 100%;
    background-color: #333333;
    color: #ffffff;
    text-align: center;
}
```
