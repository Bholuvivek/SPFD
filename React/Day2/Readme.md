# Day 2: Understanding Components and JSX

Welcome to Day 2 of our React learning journey! Today, we will dive deeper into React components and JSX syntax.

## React Components

In React, components are the building blocks of a UI. They allow you to split the UI into independent and reusable pieces. There are two main types of components in React:

### Functional Components

Functional components are JavaScript functions that return JSX (JavaScript XML) to describe what should appear on the screen. They are the simplest form of React components.

```jsx
// Functional Component Example
const Welcome = () => {
  return <h1>Welcome to My React App!</h1>;
};
```

# Class Components

Class components are ES6 classes that extend the React.Component class. They define a render() method to return JSX. Class components have additional features like local state and lifecycle methods.

```jsx
// Class Component Example
class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Welcome to My React App!</h1>;
  }
}

```

# JSX Syntax
JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript. It allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript. JSX makes React components more readable and easier to write.

```jsx
// JSX Syntax Example
const element = <h1>Hello, Vivek!</h1>;

```

# In JSX:

- You can use HTML tags directly.
- You can include JavaScript expressions inside curly braces {}.
- JSX elements can have attributes like HTML elements.
- Creating and Rendering React Components
- To create and render React components, you need to import React and use the ReactDOM.render() method to mount the component to the DOM.

```jsx
// App.js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

// Define a functional component
const Welcome = () => {
  return <h1>Welcome to My React App!</h1>;
};

// Render the component to the DOM
ReactDOM.render(<Welcome />, document.getElementById('root'));

```

# Real-World Example: Todo List App
- Let's create a simple todo list application using React components and JSX. We'll define a TodoApp component that renders a list of todos stored in an array.

```jsx
// TodoApp.js
import React from 'react';

const TodoApp = () => {
  const todos = ['Learn React', 'Build a Todo App', 'Deploy to Heroku'];

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Todo List</h1>
      <ul>
        {todos.map((todo, index) => (
          <li key={index}>{todo}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};

export default TodoApp;

```
# Conclusion
Understanding React components and JSX syntax is fundamental for building React applications. Experiment with creating components and using JSX to describe UI elements effectively. Stay tuned for tomorrow's lesson!
