# What is React Query?

- React Query is a library for managing server state in React applications. It helps you handle fetching, caching, updating, and synchronizing server state with your UI. It simplifies data management by providing a clean and intuitive API.

# Where to Use React Query:

- You can use React Query in various scenarios in your React application, including:

  - Fetching data from APIs.
  - Caching data to avoid unnecessary re-fetching.
  - Background data fetching.
  - Polling for real-time updates.
  - Mutating data (e.g., creating, updating, deleting).

# How to Implement React Query:

These are basic steps we have to follow to implement in your project.

# Step1 :

**Installations**

- Start by installing React Query and any additional dependencies like Axios (for making HTTP requests) if needed.

```bash
npm install react-query axios
```

# Step 2 :

**SetUp** Import React Query and any other necessary libraries into your project.

```javascript
    Import React Query and any other necessary libraries into your project.

javascript

import { useQuery } from 'react-query';
import axios from 'axios';
```

# Step 3 :

**Fetching Data:** Define a function to fetch data from your API using Axios or any other HTTP client.

```javascript
const fetchData = async () => {
  const response = await axios.get("https://api.example.com/data");
  return response.data;
};
```

**Using useQuery Hook:** Inside your React component, use the useQuery hook provided by React Query. Pass it the key for your query (a unique identifier), and the function to fetch data.

```javascript
const MyComponent = () => {
  const { data, isLoading, error } = useQuery("myData", fetchData);

  if (isLoading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
  if (error) return <div>Error: {error.message}</div>;

  return (
    <div>
      {data && data.map((item) => <div key={item.id}>{item.name}</div>)}
    </div>
  );
};
```
